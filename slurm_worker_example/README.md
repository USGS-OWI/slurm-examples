# SLURM Worker example

This is an example of a SLURM job. This is a 
simple, common job style, where the work will be split
across a small to medium number of worker nodes. I have included
an example of how to pull out the worker node ID and the total
number of worker nodes. This will allow you to partition the work
as you see fit.
